                <h2>About Mangata & Gallo</h2><hr>
                <p>Mangata and Gallo is a jewelry store that specializes in special occasions like engagements,
                    weddings and anniversaries. The jewelry company primarily operates online and has a small storefront in Austin, Texas
                    with an atelier attached for browsing. Mangata & Gallo's selection of jewelry is known for its high-quality and classic look.
                    The owner, an Austin local, is well known for her jewelry designs.  </p>
                <p> Mariana is the owner and the lead designer of Mangata and Gallo.
                    After graduating from design school with a specialization in diamond cutting and metal smithing, Mariana opened a store in her hometown, Austin and started to grow her business online.
                    Mariana has always managed every aspect of the business, from jewelry design to marketing to e-commerce. However, she recently hired several artisans to help craft her designs and a young
                    employee to help manage the company website and social media accounts.</p>
